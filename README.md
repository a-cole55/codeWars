Codewars Daily Challenges

Description:
Daily Codewars coding challenges to document my progress in JavaScript and Python. Each day, I complete a Codewars.com coding challenge to improve my coding skills in both JavaScript and Python. Here is where I post the daily challenge, my solution, and a few test cases (as provided by Codewars). In order to view my challenge simply click on the .js or .py file of choice. If .js, you will need to link the js file to an HTML to see the code "at work".
